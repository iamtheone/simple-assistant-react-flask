This project-based course teaches students to build an AI chat application using React, Flask, and OpenAI's API. Students will progressively enhance their application through four phases, each adding more sophisticated features.

1. Nextra Documentation Setup
Use Nextra with Vercel for beautiful documentation pages.

Initialize a new Next.js project with Nextra:

bashCopynpx create-next-app@latest docs --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog"
cd docs
npm install nextra nextra-theme-docs

Create next.config.js:

javascriptCopyconst withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.jsx'
})

module.exports = withNextra()

Create theme.config.jsx:

jsxCopyexport default {
  logo: <span>AI Chat Application Course</span>,
  project: {
    link: 'https://github.com/yourusername/project-name'
  },
  docsRepositoryBase: 'https://github.com/yourusername/project-name/tree/main/docs',
  footer: {
    text: 'AI Chat Application Course Documentation'
  }
}
2. Documentation Structure
Create the following markdown files in the pages directory:
index.mdx:
